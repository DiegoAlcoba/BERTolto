netsec,1mls6sj,Vulnerability Management Program - How to implement SLA and its processes,ScottContini,"> Your GRC team needs a clear risk acceptance process  Consider also risk exception, which is not the same as risk acceptance.  Risk acceptance means it won’t be fixed, risk exception is a delay.  > Medium: 60-90 days > > Low: 180+ days (or tracked as tech debt)  We’re starting out only with critical vulns in our SLA and will work our way down to adding other severities.  One requirement before starting such a programme is being in somewhat of a clean state.  If they have hundreds of vulnerabilities of some severity, then the process is not going to work (too much security work that cannot be feasibly completed by deadline).  So we’re starting with critical vulnerabilities only because teams are mostly clean for this severity, but they are not so clean for lower severity.  One of the gotchas here is verified vulnerabilities versus reports from automated tools.  Verified vulnerabilities tend to be much less than those from automated tools, but ideally you want teams to address both.  You also don’t want to make it so every single vulnerability needs a risk assessment from the security team if you’re going to include those from automated tools, otherwise you need a huge security team to do those assessments.  Also, I’m not a fan of restricting access to the vulnerabilities.  If everyone has visibility to everyone else’s status, it becomes very clear who are the good teams and who needs a tap on the bottom with the wooden spoon.  Teams who need the wooden spoon tend to not like being in last place, so they are incentivised to do better when everything is visible to everyone.  Speaking from experience here."
netsec,1mls6sj,Vulnerability Management Program - How to implement SLA and its processes,GeneMoody-Action1,"And remember if it is not codified in policy, it is tribal knowledge. Tribal knowledge is not reviewed, therefore it is incongruous with policy.  There should be a policy on what you do, and SOP for how it gets done., A policy for what to do for exceptions to that policy and SOP for those edge cases as well.  Policy is the foundation of any program, get it wrong and the whole program suffers, get it right and the program is largely defined already."
netsec,1mls6sj,Vulnerability Management Program - How to implement SLA and its processes,pathetiq,Thanks love the insight. And yes my next article is about risk exceptions and acceptance processes. And definitely from critical to low vuln but also on the system (inventory) of the systems in order of risk.  As for the automated tool. If interested that's my previous article in the blog showing how to reduce the automated tools vulns (triage them).  For restricting I'm also yes and no but we had so many with sensitive data that a need to know what more useful then everyone seeing everything. I don't see this as a team deterrent though cause engineering teams won't spend their time looking at vuln for fun if they don't own them so not sure how they will feel bad about it.
netsec,1mls6sj,Vulnerability Management Program - How to implement SLA and its processes,pathetiq,Great point. And sometimes in the middle of the fire we forget to make sure a policy is made so always make sure it is and it's also published to all engineering teams.

And it is one we are all guilty of, tech changes fast, security in tech, faster. Policy will always struggle to keep up. But is a sword and a shield, part of the reason the state of digital security exists in the fringes it does is because people still see this as a drain on a bottom line vs a business function as essential as electricity and water. I have assisted in creating a few policies in my days, and 99% of the time the people who always task IT with ""making it happen"" get an eye opening experience in what it takes to ""make it happen"". They think it is magic and we are wizards, but in reality our job is not much different than the accountant...      ...if math changed weekly, the results of formulas were up for interpretation, and numbers blinked in and out of existence randomly.

In other words: if, as an inverse proxy, I simply squash the OSI stack: something that came in from one TCP session will never be split up to different handling hosts.

And if you kill HTTP/1.1 than you kill also all ""normal"" non-reverse-proxy-webservers, because of course ""EVERYTHING"" has to be killed.

netsec,1mhj0ek,Finding vulnerabilities in Claude code,Globbi,">ok, this is a really stupid question, and a bit off topic also, but so far i've been avoiding AI when it comes to coding.  >so, what i don't get: when you use something like claude, it uploads all your code? like... people just hand over their code bases to openai, google, anthropic, etc?   The code does go inside the context of prompts to the APIs, yes. But it shouldn't be saved anywhere in paid versions of services. Free tiers usually will use your data to train future models.  ___  Chatbots are different and have conversation history saved on purpose. Some chatbot services might allow you to (might also depend on paid versions) not save your data. This is your data that you put on the internet that someone saves in a DB, and this data could potentially leak. So obviously that's up to you to not share your sensitive information, just like you should avoid sharing such information anywhere else when it's not needed. ___  When working on your own code you make a decision yourself. When working in a company that owns the code, someone makes the decision for you. You shouldn't use AI tools at all if you work on a client's code and he doesn't agree to it.  Some companies use their own deployments of models where the model providers won't have access to the data at all. It's usually included as ready services of cloud providers, but what you pay for is both the compute and the licensing to model providers.  Technically MS could have access to your data when it's a deployment in Azure, or Google when it's a deployment in GCP. But if you use those services they likely already have access to your full codebase through git repositories in their clouds and your full data in their managed DB services. The data is also sent through API calls when you use those DBs. Sending it again to LLMs is an extra potential point of failure, but that's nothing crazy.  ___  If you really don't want to (or legally can't) put the data anywhere else except local servers of the client, then you also can't send it to LLMs. Unless you actually deploy an open source LLM in those servers as well (which is very doable)."

netsec,1mhj0ek,Finding vulnerabilities in Claude code,SilentLennie,"> i get your remarks about self hosted models, but i feel the growing size of newer models will make that somewhat difficult.   The reason the size of the models grew was to get to a point of quality that is 'good enough'. I actually think we are now at that point and I think we'll see models become more specialized/smaller/even more efficient again.  At the moment something like Qwen 3 Coder still requires probably 2 Macs with 512GB of unified RAM as the cheapest option if you want some kind of speed (I have not checked if this actually works, I'm just going by memory requirement), They are about US $10 000 each, so that's 20k, not so affordable for a single person, but for a company maybe an affordable option.  At the moment when I use 'gen code', I use it on green field projects (so no existing code is supplied) for internal services which are not reachable from the Internet (any security bugs introduced in the code are at least not directly reachable). Like Kubernetes Operators - in my case they don't have much of an API, they just talk to other APIs (get data from Kubernetes API and send it to other API). Also if it ever turns out there is a huge copyright legal problem with these AI output, I can throw away these green field projects and start over without worrying about code included in other projects."

Since you seems to be in contact with the developers, I wonder if you could ask them to take another look.  For example, [stripShellPattern](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/4795/files#diff-a55ec0b7c822f33efea15fec3cbabe32d980e5360c0ea806c95923e46f921f7eR107) uses a very deficient regular expression.  Problems with it are:  - dot in `cmd.exe` is not escaped (you could probably have a `cmd․exe` in the repo's local folder and fool Gemini into executing that - the character in the middle is not a dot, but a One Dot Leader (U+2024)) - `cmd` can be typed without the `.exe` and it will not be matched to the pattern - the prefixes to `sh`/`bash`/etc are only whitespaces, meaning `/usr/bin/bash` will evade the regex - Are `sh|bash|zsh` the full list of *nix shell the authors ever heard of? There are plenty more!  Meaning, it will be possible to get Gemini to ask the user to allow execution of `/usr/bin/bash` instead of the actual command in the script. While I'd expect the user to not allow a random shell script execution, it is still not nice to be able to disguise the actual command that is about to be executed."

They happily collect their 15–30% cut from App Store subscriptions like it’s protection money, but when it comes to actual accountability for the apps’ content, conduct, or business practices? Suddenly they’re just “a neutral platform.”  That’s the neat legal trick: they’re the host, the billing intermediary, the gatekeeper for getting on iOS devices at all… yet they’ve managed to sidestep much of the product liability, customer service responsibility, and even consumer protection obligations by claiming the apps themselves are the “merchants of record” for everything but the payment. It’s a lucrative loophole — they can boot a shady app if it gets too toxic in the headlines, but until then, it’s not their circus, not their monkeys.  The part regulators keep circling is that their control over distribution, payment processing, and rules for how apps behave starts to look a lot like active participation. But Apple’s lawyers have spent years making sure “participation” is never quite the same thing as “responsibility.” It’s a balancing act between plausible deniability and market dominance, and so far they’ve managed to keep both.

AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,MyChickenNinja,"Just curious if you verified the findings. Last couple times I used masscan, I got more results but the open ports weren't actually open when I check manually."
AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,TempestRQ,Masscan is built specifically for speed and uses its own custom TCP/IP stack instead of relying on the OS networking stack like most other scanners. This gives it way more control over timing and packet handling. The other tools you mentioned often have default rate limits or use the OS stack which can drop packets under heavy load. Masscan just brute forces through with raw sockets at whatever rate you set. That's probably why you're seeing more consistent results with it.
AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,Leather-Sugar5379,yes but seems not the reason why masscan is so accuracy. does it using some retransimission methods?
AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,strandjs,"It separates the two parts of the scanner into two different services.   One, sends SYN packets reaaaaalllyy fast.   The other just listens for SYN/ACKs.   The original idea was from Dan Kaminsky.   HTH"
AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,rexstuff1,"Can confirm. Well, almost as fast as massscan. A little bit of nmap-fu can go a long way."
AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,Leather-Sugar5379,"    sudo nmap -Pn -sS --open --min-rate 1000 --max-rate 1000 -p- -T5 {target} takes more than 2.5mins with 9 open ports no false positive.      sudo masscan -p 1-65535 --rate 1000 {target} takes less than 1mins but missed some essential ports :) seems that different notwork envionments indeed influence the results.          Is there any other config for nmap is recommended, very thanks."
AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,Leather-Sugar5379,"I just scan the same target without exam multiple targets. Just in this example target all the opened ports are valid. In some situation, nmap generated FP more than masscan. However it just some personal experience."
AskNetsec,1mlatat,why masscan is accuracy and fast?,GeronimoHero,Yeah this has been my experience with masscan as well. More false positives.

AskNetsec,1mlq1nl,Why Many requests to suspicious IPs using chrome.exe & edge.exe process,rexstuff1,"Yes, this happens all the time. Nothing to see here.  An IP address will be used in a malicious campaign for a time, reported, then retired and reclaimed by the cloud provider and given out to someone else, who is not malicious. Or it may front multiple websites, some which may host malware.  IP-based indicators are almost useless, unless they are extremely fresh and/or you're working through an active incident."

AskNetsec,1mkbj30,Network Issues after Bug Bounty Activity,aecyberpro,You’ve been blocked by Akamai. I’d try to get a new IP address from your ISP by rebooting your router. If that doesn’t work I don’t know what to tell you. But from now on you need to proxy your traffic through an AWS free tier EC2 instance or other VPS when hacking on bug bounties.
AskNetsec,1mkbj30,Network Issues after Bug Bounty Activity,Notoriusboi,"proxying traffic through amazon ec instance will probably not work as well, since they will see its a datacenter proxy and block it, i think best option is to try a vpn or a mobile/residential http proxy"
AskNetsec,1mjj41n,Can anyone think of anything I'm NOT currently doing to secure my self-hosted setup?,NegativeK,"I skimmed your site (forgive me), but some suggestions: start looking into tools like forensics tools, network monitoring, EDR, and SIEM. There are options for all of those, but you could get started with some example open source tools: Velociraptor, Security Onion, Wazuh, and ELK (or maybe just one of Wazuh and ELK.)  Want to make it like a job? Start publishing extensive documentation on what you're setting up. It doesn't have to be a narrative; you can detail the what, the how, and the why for yourself (and others) who come along later to the docs. No, documentation isn't explicitly patching vulns. Yes, it's helping you secure your setup by writing down what you're doing so that future you can fix things quicker.  Want to make it a little more fun? Purple team (ish) yourself. Set up a VM with a service that you know is vulnerable. Could be a configuration, could be you copying a HTB challenge, could be a known vulnerable version of a service. Exploit the vulnerability. Then use open source tools like what I mentioned in the second paragraph to detect your actions. Don't just assume that you have to get in from the outside, either -- if you're stuck at a step, you can assume you were successful and try the next step. Ransomware yourself. Exfiltrate data. Establish persistence. Detect and fix those actions.  Then try to exploit it again without triggering the detections you've created. You can probably see where this is going. Repeat and tune. And then see if you can create more general detections that are less brittle and can catch multiple different attacks. Want more detections? Detonate malware somewhere safe and detect it.  Are you sure that the tools you installed and configured have the right insights to help you respond? Do they have too _much_ data coming at you?  Then automate it. I don't care what ""it"" is; start automating the things you're doing to make them faster. Automate service setup and configuration; automate responses to the detections; automate the attacks and the infrastructure you need to do the attacks.  I may not seem like I'm directly answering your question, but the paragraphs above are a path for a _lot_ of learning that will teach you how to maintain security software to protect your systems. Because:  ""You can't defend. You can't prevent. The only thing you can do is detect and respond."""
AskNetsec,1mjj41n,Can anyone think of anything I'm NOT currently doing to secure my self-hosted setup?,red-joeysh,"I only skimmed through what you wrote, as I'm on the go, but here are a few thoughts from the top of my head.  First, I would remove this article from the net, as you provided an attacker with a grocery list of what and where to focus.  Second, remove all the auto updates you're doing, especially on Linux. You did all that work and then allowed a blind service install whatever it wants, using God mode privileges.  Firefox Relay doesn't fight spam. It is an alias mechanism. It helps, but the spam still gets to your inbox. I would use a more private service, such as Proton.  You use LastPass, which suffered a [catastrophic breach](https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/security-incident-update-recommended-actions) two years ago, compromising users' passwords.

Most of it reads like AI slop also.   All it reads like is you asked Claude to setup an imaginary homelab and apply security best practices. All of this stuff is fairly standard and is mostly un interesting from a security perspective. That isn't to say it's wrong or something. But it's not interesting. It has no depth. Additionally any external threat actor is not realy going to be interested in what you have written down. If a threat actor wants to get in. They will get in. It's only a matter of time and money. You can do all the protection in the world but if an automation fails and U aren't there to catch it and ur machine is zero day exploitable for a few hours then that's it. Having all this defensive posturing is fine. And kudos to you if you actually set all that up urself for some reason. Give it some sort of interesting depth and rewrite the sections that sound like AI dribble.   As a thought that just occured to me why don't you set up your little fortress and then try penetrate it yourself. Not just with a network scan tool to find exploitable cves.... I'm talking osint yourself. Plan out your own attack as if you didn't know about yourself. Forget everything you know and approach this from the perspective of ""I must penetrate this network or I will die"" .   Do you have risk assessments?   Do you have vulnerability reports?  Do you have a critical risk matrix?  Have you looked at your local state governments risk assessment framework?  Have you applied that?  Can you complete an information security management report on your project following local state government framework?  A lot of people forget one difference between a hacker and a cyber security person is one fills out paper work. I don't really know how much that's going to apply to you. My guess is that your website is advertising for you yourself for job opportunities.   Anyway. As I said I think what you have done is fine. It's just not interesting and any security professional who looks over this will just get glazed eyes after the first few lines. You could have summarised it in ""the network is secure as it can be"" and then provide your risk assessment. Which hopefully gets to the point.   Goodluck and try hack urself. Not just ur network.

Then execute. fuzzing and record traffic then use use tool to send fuzzed traffic pcap back to wire (tcpdump or tcpreplay could work this point). You can use pure lua which is very powerful for protocol stuff. Read rfcs of the protocol that you would like to work create dissector and parser then keep working with other phases.

For tools I would recommend Wiz for cloud security scanning, Snyk for DAST and SCA to look for code level vulnerabilities and third-party dependencies. For network, Nessus and Qualys are both great options and Burpsuite is the GOAT for web application VA scanner. Some firms offers compliance led pentests and they will map the vulnerabilities discovered to HIPAA controls as part of the pentest report. 2. Automated only tests can catch surface level low hanging fruits, it is recommended specially for HIPAA compliant orgs to have a mix of both automated and manual.  3. Risk reporting is through a standard such as CVSS score, PHI should be encrypted both at transit and at rest. For documentation, you could use a GRC automation platform, there are a ton of them but a few reputable ones are Mycroft, Sprinto, Vanta.  Healthcare provider stores really sensitive PII data, continous penetration testing would be ideal specially which includes adhoc tests after major changes or upgrade, once a year pentest won't be sufficient if something changes right after that could make you vulnerable.

AskNetsec,1mhh43l,How do boards react to frameworks such as NIST CSF?,gormami,"I think it is becoming more common for these kinds of discussion to happen in boards.  The news targeted at those levels includes a lot of it, and when one really looks at them, they are more geared toward the business and process than the technical aspect.    I actually run into the inverse a lot.  Our customers ask how our product maps to NIST CSF, or C2M2, or some other framework.  The issue is, while we enable some of the technical aspects well, the bulk of the framework is process based.  We don't train your employees on cybersecurity, we don't write your DR plans, etc.  We provide secure connectivity, and that maps to a few technical points, or general ones about remote access, etc.    I do think in a conversation with board level folks, it is important how you approach it. Making sure you lead with the process side, and how the overall framework is designed to reduce business risk is important.  If any technical questions come up, you can sideline them, saying yes, there is a specific technical requirement for X (though there are few) and we have a solution, or we understand it and it a simple technical matter to resolve, then get back to getting their buy in for people and process."

But as you move further away from those, it becomes far less relevant. If the answer to ""why should I care"" isn't ""because our regulators or major partners do"", CSFs will generally be met with a collective shrug.

WTF Reddit, do better.   Anyway, this is Part I of II.   I put this as a reply to u/extreme4all, but then realized it's really a reply to the OP so I moved it. I also noticed after I typed it that u/Sqooky touched on it.  So I can't say exactly why, but at an org I worked previously caching Domain User accounts was by design. They had to be cached, so they could login before the convoluted connection back to the domain and domain resources occurred.  Cached credentials are stored in mscache. Unlike NTLM, mscache cannot be PTHed. It can be cracked, but it takes longer and of course the wordlist you're using for would have to actually contain the password.  IMHO Protected Users is good for Domain Admin level accounts that  * have no legitimate need to be cached * are only used for Domain Admin tasks (no email, Googling, etc) * are only used while connected to DCs, because they're no good otherwise  You also want to disable delegation for these accounts as this stops PTT attacker shenanigans.  \--- break ---  A couple other points on the OP's list, since I didn't see anyone else mention them yet.  * 'Smartcard required for interactive login' doesn't stop PTH, in fact on older domains that don't roll hashes by default it makes it worse as the hash doesn't change when the PIN is changed, a new smartcard is issued, etc. * Disabling RC4 only slows down a Kerberoasting attack. It doesn't stop it. Strong passwords or better yet using gMSAs is a better answer here. * The OP's list didn't mention disabling LLMNR, NetBIOS, mDNS, and enforcing SMB signing on all domain endpoints via Group Policy. I don't know why, this stops all sorts of attacker shenanigans. It's also something than all the orgs I have worked for failed to do, no matter how much I tried to tell them. * Most importantly, the OP's list didn't mention DACLs at all. IMHO DACLs are the heart and soul of security in Windows in general, not just AD. You ignore them or remain ignorant of them at your own peril."

It's not easy or fast AT ALL. But it is doable. Although credential guard (especially remote credential guard) can introduce some headaches WRT to access to other on-prem resources from within RDP sessions and issues with DFS from any session, without careful planning and implementation.  A potentially bigger problem likely to make putting accounts in the protected users group a show-stopper for anyone in today's world is that users in that group are not synced to RODCs by default. This also means they won't sync to Entra, because the fake DC used for SSO with Entra is a read-only DC. And removing that group from the default exclusions isn't advisable."

AskNetsec,1mfdowy,How do I prevent attackers who compromised an AD-joined computer from escalating privileges?,dodexahedron,"IMO LAPS is one of the best major security features added to AD in recent-ish history, because it addresses that issue specifically, which was otherwise an extremely common practice for AD deployments - probably to the point that adding such a group to local admins via GP was a checklist item for new deployments for people.  I really wish they'd make configuring it a bit less arcane, though. If you follow all the other AD security best practices, the MS Learn deployment guide for LAPS won't work due to other policies that break the configuration in that guide (a biggie being disallowing enumeration of SAM accounts and disallowing anonymous translation of SIDs, which you absolutely should be doing of course). Since you can put a SID, a DN, or a sAMAccountName in that configuration, it isn't so clear which you SHOULD do. They need to make a better UI for that, and also make the alternative means of setting it up (the PowerShell module/scripts for it), do a better job of validating input against policy so things will work in the end.  LAPS can go a long way in disrupting lateral movement if some random machine or account is compromised, so it really is a MUST in any environment."

AskNetsec,1mfe5i2,The difference between a proxy server and an authorization server. WAF and proxy server protection,mustu,"\> Proxy server != Auth server?  Yes, a proxy server and an authorization server are completely different.  \> If yes, can the Api endpoint be behind both the proxy and the auth server?  Yes, this is the standard architecture for modern, secure applications.  \> If the WAF is configured correctly and is in front of the proxy server, does it make sense to duplicate protection against injections, etc. on the proxy server?  WAF specialized in filtering malicious Layer 7 traffic (OWASP Top 10). It's designed for this and does it best. The proxy is for routing, caching, and managing traffic. It does not make sense to duplicate protection against threats like SQL injection on the proxy itself.  \> If the WAF is configured poorly, but the proxy reflects injections, etc., does it make sense to test the Auth server for injections?  Yes, you must always test the Authorization Server for injections and other vulnerabilities, regardless of what's in front of it. The Authorization Server is a high-value target because it controls access to everything. It must be independently secure and hardened against all relevant attacks.  \> How to distinguish WAF protection from proxy server protection?  By examining the block response. WAFs often return a branded block page with a unique ID for the blocked request (e.g., ""Your request was blocked by Cloudflare, incident ID: ...""). A proxy server block is typically more generic, like a simple `403 Forbidden` response."

The concern is that you are exposing the most sensitive infrastructure of your entire domain to be scanned and interacted with by the hive of scum and villainy that is the internet.

AskNetsec,1memwj5,Why is Active Directory not safe to use on the public Internet?,PaluMacil,"I have a former coworker that could probably recreate some of the old RFCs from memory. Unfortunately he isn’t here, but I remember him talking about a long list of details where the implementations themselves differ from the RFC. In this case we were writing a privilege access management product that used Active Directory to apply policy to a couple types of BSD systems and Centos, Debian, Fedora and probably some I’ve forgotten. After a merger, the product never saw the light of day and I resigned. However, my area of work has been in cybersecurity for a while now, and the thing that sticks out to me is far less technical than philosophical. Yes, the DOS and attack surface stand out to me. The thing that stands out most is the defense in depth concept. Your identity is the most precious resource you own. Most serious breaches wind up doing the most damage through existing privileged accounts at the end. If you can have network segmentation between you and the internet in terms of your IdP, do it.  Final technical randomness thoughts: AD relies on several protocols designed without the internet in mind. One of the three main ways to attack a system is availability. If I were to attack you, I would start with anything I could do to make systems lose availability. If you use Azure AD (now called Entra) you leverage OIDC which was made for the internet. You can sync AD to it"

AskNetsec,1memwj5,Why is Active Directory not safe to use on the public Internet?,PaluMacil,"Yeah, it does. Azure Active Directory was probably renamed to Entra mostly because it is so different from Active Directory in operation and even protocols, though they state wanting to position marketing more around web identity and access instead of being a directory. It’s pretty easy to sync Entra with AD and that’s how I would like to see people do it 99% of the time, but it lacks device groups (kinda—they don’t manage group policy in Entra but can relate devices to conditional access) and org units if I recall correctly. If you need the full AD functionality, ADFS is a way to use AD for auth without AD itself being accessible (not exposing LDAP Kerberos or NTLM), but you still want to have a WAF or at least IIS in front proxying the traffic to reduce surface area exposed.  Caveat: I’m a principal software engineer in a cybersecurity company so I care about these things and ask questions when something looks concerning, but I am not myself an infrastructure engineer, so I would defer to one of those for the actual configuration."
AskNetsec,1memwj5,Why is Active Directory not safe to use on the public Internet?,Virtual_Search3467,"Not just in a cloud; the entire premise of AD - that of a general authentication and management system- is outdated. As it’s entirely stateful, you get problems in a stateless environment, and in turn it doesn’t scale well. Worse perhaps as you throw more nodes at the infrastructure, it gets less reliable instead of more.   Worse, but that’s not an inherent problem of AD, is that Microsoft has been neglecting it for a while and is now struggling because of it. Following that, it’s easy to conclude Microsoft may at some point deprecate AD entirely… perhaps even pointing to third party solutions to replace it (there’s precedent). That makes AD an inherently problematic strategy to follow.   Regardless of where you run it, AD has the advantage of being easy to set up (but not to administrate). Put a nuc somewhere, install a windows server OE on it and it will work fine as a domain controller. No particular prerequisites needed.   But in turn it’s pretty much useless for specific security models. Zero trust and ad won’t be easy. It’s possible sure but with AD, instead of using Microsoft’s sample configuration, you get to discard that and build your own…. Or you get a lot of extra work trying to make a centralized system work decentralized.   So what I’m trying to say… is what’s “better”? Ad has the advantage of working out of the box, but its defaults are horribly out of date and Microsoft has for a very long time adhered to the Everything must work doctrine, to the point where you could join win2000 and even older clients to the domain… by default.    If you take another approach, if you’re more into decentralized management of individual services that get authenticated on a per-case basis, and you stop authenticating things on a per user or per computer basis (that then lets you do whatever within the context of either) it means things will inherently be much more secure, and easier to maintain; but in turn it’ll be a pain to design and set up.   Then there’s some break even moment in the middle somewhere, where overhead gets too great in relation to the number of managed systems and/or users. Obviously, what’s “better” will be a little different then.   Basically … even if our assumed environment cloud is not viable (full disclosure; I don’t think it’s viable at all when it’s exposed to the public internet; not because of AD though) I also think cloud-style strategies should be considered for on-premise implementations too. Not only will it make migrations easier, it’ll also mean management gets more consistent and therefore more efficient.   It doesn’t mean you’d have to run a private data center, but it would mean you need more hardware; so it would be more suited for larger environments.   If on the other hand we’re looking at something rather smaller, and cloud isn’t viable, then AD is a good idea because there’s much less work required to get it going. You pay for that by needing more time and knowledge to manage it properly, though, so it’s hardly a great option; especially since in smaller environments, it’s exactly these that are usually lacking.   At the end of the day… if there’s an out of the box platform you can use for managing your environment, that’s great for being useful but crap for security. The opposite is also true.   So what’s “better” is in the eye of the beholder.   Full disclosure: I’m a firm proponent of decentralized management systems that are run on premise; with a dedicated team managing them (no matter who pays them). If there’s ways to consolidate things in a data center, sure; IF you trust the hosting company with your life. Because that’s what it boils down to if you hand over your everything to them.   And that has nothing to do with whatever software you run to manage things."

AskNetsec,1memwj5,Why is Active Directory not safe to use on the public Internet?,AdminSDHolder,"Naw, this engagement was performed by a principal consultant at a highly regarded firm with a team behind them.    And perhaps I wasn't being clear. In this environment getting DA isn't even a goal. You likely wouldn't achieve DA, but it's not an end game for the environment. I gave DA creds to the tester as an assumption in the assumed breach after we'd already made assumptions like getting code execution, loosened outbound firewall rules to get a beacon, and handing over local admin rights. DA is removed from the default of being local admins on everything except domain controllers. DA is prevented from interactive and remote interactive logins everywhere but DCs and PAWs (real T0 PAWS, not jump boxes). DA is prevented from retrieving TGT anywhere but DCs and PAWs. And if you somehow manage to create or attempt a DA session from anywhere but tier zero you lose your network connection to everything, even if it's an unmanaged device.  Any DA login outside of an extremely narrow scope is an actionable alert as DA accounts are only used to actually modify the domain itself, not perform everyday tasks, which are all delegated.  There's probably some weakness that can be exploited, there always is. Nothing is perfect. And yet there are enough barriers and opportunities for detection for me to have slept quite soundly.

AskNetsec,1memwj5,Why is Active Directory not safe to use on the public Internet?,Rolex_throwaway,"You are fundamentally misunderstanding. The issue is not that there are “vulnerabilities” in it, like you are thinking. Its very functionality is a vulnerability. The public facing services like GitHub that you described have layers of controls between the outside and actual access to the application and sensitive data stored within. Active Directory has none of those, because it is not intended to be put on the internet. Letting the public internet directly query your AD guarantees rapid compromise.  In addition to the inherent problems with the idea itself, vulnerability management becomes impossible. There is a reason companies don’t automatically patch the moment a patch becomes available. That is an extremely risky thing to do, and you will certainly break things in your business if you do it.   I think you would also be surprised what the actual domain functional level in the wild is. Most companies don’t even have access to the security features available in modern AD, because they’ve never upgraded their DFL, because it would break business critical applications for them to do so. There are boatloads of companies with fully patched modern DC’s, who never upgraded the DFL past 2008 R2.  You also have to account for the fact that patches aren’t released immediately upon discovery of a vulnerability. There is often a window of vulnerability between disclosure and patch, but threat actors exploit automatically at large scale once an exploit is published. If AD isn’t publicly exposed, you don’t have to worry about exploitation unless your network is already compromised.  The secrets stored within AD cannot be remediated if they are compromised, so with public facing Active Directory that would mean in the event of a public exploit, you go from zero to rebuilding your entire network instantly. It’s like intentionally building your network to be maximally fragile, so that it will completely shatter when someone breathes on it. It is the very worst architecture imaginable.  Your question is the architecture equivalent of asking “Why do NFL players wear cups, instead of cutting a hole in their pants and playing with their junk hanging out?”"

Imagine you have a payload you need to get onto a machine, but you need to have a signed executable, so you sneak the payload in the padding and read it from there.  3CX compromise is a case of this in the wild, and Google being a prime candidate for using this “feature” to update Chrome."
AskNetsec,1mbv1od,"Theoretically speaking, can the signature of a software be modified to be the same as the modified software ?",Lord_Wither,"I think there are three different attacks you might be thinking of here.   The first would be a case where you are not actually provided with a digital signature but just a hash, such as on some download pages. As you suspected, you could just clone that download page, upload your modified software and provide the correct hash for that modified version. This would work unless your target already got the actual hash from some other trusted location. This attack is precisely why such a hash really only guards against errors in the download, not an actual attacker and why you want a digital signature.  A digital signature then is basically a hash authenticated with some fancy asymmetric cryptography. To create such a signature you need the private key associated with the public key in the signature, which an attacker would not have.  The second attack would be finding a way of generating some modified software such that the original signature is still valid for it. This would require either finding some place you can put changes into the software package that is not covered by the actual signature or finding a [Second-Preimage Attack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack) against the hash function used to create that hash that then gets authenticated. There is some precedent for the former in padding issues or some metadata not being included, but this isn't really useful. The latter would be an absolutely huge deal, breaking tons of systems and allowing you to do much more interesting things than just faking some software.  The third attack would be just creating your own public and private-key pair and signing your modified software with that. To prevent this, there are various schemes of ensuring a public key is actually trusted to sign that software by somehow proving it is associated with the organization or person creating the legitimate software. These systems are called Public Key Infrastructures or PKIs. You basically see two kinds:  One is a hierarchical system where the public key is included in a certificate, which is basically some data describing who the public key belongs to and what it is allowed to be used for along with another signature from what is called a Certificate Authority or CA, the public key for which is included in another certificate signed by a higher-up CA until you end up with a certificate signed by a so-called Root CA. Your operating system comes with a short list of root CAs which trust ultimate derives from. This scheme is used in software signatures under windows, but is also used to e.g. prove you are actually talking to the right server when using HTTPS.  The other is what is called a web of trust. You have something similar to a certificate in the hierarchical system associating the key with an identity but instead of some higher authority, this data is signed by peers, generally signing each other's keys after validating it belongs to that person by e.g. meeting in person. You basically trust a public key if it is trusted by someone you trust (e.g. because you know them personally and have verified their public key or because they are the maintainers of your operating system whose keys came with said operating system). The most common scheme here is PGP."

There are a ton of issues but the problem is that they don't have security teams. Because they are one computer shop. They aren't as much of a target because they are small potatoes and if they get hacked it's random because they don't have anything worth selling. Maybe ransom would make money but it would be a small ransom. They may get hit with some random malware every now and then but it's usually a blanket attack and not targeted.   I personally stayed away from small business because you will be the security guy and the guy that talks to the customers that sells the product and the guy who brings out the trash.

Makes malware installs or persistence dead simple.  \- Backups that don’t restore. Seen ransomware cases where backups existed but were broken, incomplete, or too slow to be useful.

The NAC solution turns off your device's auto-discovery feature, so your device won't just hop networks on its own. It will have to be manual.

AskNetsec,1lz226k,Security professional learning coding,netbroom,"As far as how far you should go into learning Python, my suggestion is to pick a project that you want to work on and let that guide you. This is the tldr;  For example if you want to built a program to collect data from various APIs, then you'll learn how to make network requests and parse data.  If you want to build a web scraper, you'll learn about browser automation, optimizing your code, interacting with websites, probably multithreading/multiprocessing, etc.  If you want to store your data, you'll probably get better at database management, local storage, Redis or memcached, etc depending on how you want to do it.  Machine learning, file processing/analysis, etc are all projects you could work on, just depends what you want to do with it.  Everything you learn will give you context into different types of security incidents as well depending on what assets are impacted and what the attack vector is. For example, working with databases will give you insights into SQL injection, while working with JS and web development will give you insights into XSS and other web exploits.  If you are interested in branching out to other languages:  Python is good in security but i think that's because many people only know Python. My understanding is it's good for ML stuff because there are a lot of libraries built in Python. Personally, I've been coding for \~20 years, I don't know Python that well and have never had a reason to learn. I know that some SOARs build integrations in Python, like Splunk ( [https://github.com/splunk-soar-connectors/chronicle](https://github.com/splunk-soar-connectors/chronicle) ) and Siemplify (now Chronicle's SOAR). OpenCTI connectors are also built in Python: [https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors)   Node.js is very performant and great for data collection, API requests, and building servers. JS is great for understanding web threats/exploits. Together they are great for building web applications. I built a threat intel platform (Pulsedive) and we're migrating all the data collection and processing to Node.js. The web backend is still PHP but eventually we want to migrate that as well.  C and similar languages (eg Rust) are good for performant lower-level applications. For example, many Internet port scanners are built in C, including ZMap ( [https://github.com/zmap/zmap](https://github.com/zmap/zmap) ), Unicornscan ( [https://github.com/IFGHou/Unicornscan](https://github.com/IFGHou/Unicornscan) ) and Masscan ( [https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) ). Masscan uses a custom TCP stack.

Linux SysAdmin/Security Engineer where all the security was compliance, no coding at all involved. IAC involved no python, just lots and lots of terraform and ansible.

AskNetsec,1lz226k,Security professional learning coding,vakuoler,"In that case I'd say the sky is the limit. Many vulnerabilities boil down to developers making assumptions about data they are not in control over. Someone that is fairly knowledgeable and with the right mindset could still be useful in a business context doing code reviews, so I wouldn't suggest to mindlessly try to learn everything even though being a very skillful programmer is preferable. I mean, how do we even trust compilers? How do we ensure that the program we run is what actually is being executed on the CPU? How does the operating system compartmentalize resources used by the program? etc. As I said, the sky is a limit but sometimes we have to agree on when to give up.  Maybe you can try to narrow it down. A developer may not raise an eyebrow when XML is parsed, YAML deserialized,  non-existent boundary checking etc. but someone who does code reviews should.  Fuzzers and other tools help, but are pretty useless if one cannot understand their results.  For code review I suggest looking for common issues and weaknesses in the particular language you're working on and try to recreate these vulnerabilities including code that exploits them. I also recommend to create a story around them to put into a context where your can explain to others why they're relevant, if not they're mostly just ""bugs"" to other people. If you can explain them top down from business risk to technical details you're hired! 🙂  Other than that, just get into whatever is written about application security.  Automation is easier. Modern languages and fast computers makes it trivial without needing to understand much about memory management, data structures, algorithms and whatnot. Some understanding of flow control and Python and  you're good to go for many tasks. Especially since there's an external library for pretty much everything. Things intended to be used in production environment I would spend some more time actually learning the language and its pitfalls though."
AskNetsec,1lz226k,Security professional learning coding,Got2InfoSec4MoneyLOL,"You got chatgpt to assist reviews and soar is done with very specific tools, which you get to learn them on the job when they decide to integrate them in your company.  You are wasting your time with generic coding. Either your form a very specific idea in your head and start building on it or you actually spend your time doing actual security training.  Coding is fun, but other than the odd script review (powershell, python) it is not a daily thing in security unless you are working in application security which requires extended prior experience.  Building exploits and relevant PoCs is a completely different story."
AskNetsec,1lz226k,Security professional learning coding,ThrowAway516536,PHP isn’t used much. The only reason to learn PHP today is to maintain old legacy code. Basically what everyone hates doing. I haven’t heard about anyone using much PHP the last ten years.
AskNetsec,1lz226k,Security professional learning coding,AYamHah,"Appsec - I'd recommend going through the [portswigger.net/academy](http://portswigger.net/academy) training.      Learning PHP   It's not about the language, it's the code patterns. PHP is just an easy way to get started learning, and you'll be outputting to responses directly through Echo statements, rather than through abstractions and frameworks. It'll help you really see what you're doing. Especially when you hook up Burp to your browser so you have a full view of the client side and server side.   Learn how to validate input. Learn how to sanitize output for HTML, URL, and JS contexts. You do all this, you'll be way ahead."
AskNetsec,1lz226k,Security professional learning coding,ThrowAway516536,"Thank you. As far as coding goes, the only way to learn it, is to write a whole lot of code. Preferably together with other people as well. By reading about it and taking courses, it will feel like you understand it and can do it. But if you don’t write a lot of code, you simply won’t be able to create anything of value. I mean, you should do a course. But you should also quickly move onto building your own projects.   Python is a nice beginner language. A good first project could be to write the backend of a web service or an API yourself. Build something that you want to use yourself. It will likely teach you a few things about security too. Like how do SQL injection ACTUALLY work. How do you prevent it. Etc etc.   You should also learn good development hygiene. Using git, branches, merging etc. even for your own projects.   I also suggest learning design patterns. For a lot of problems in computer science, there are known solutions that work. And these problems come up again and again. In some languages a given solution is almost baked into the language and in other it’s not. For example you wouldn’t normally write a builder in Kotlin, but you would in Java.   Being a SQL ninja is also very helpful. SQL is easy to learn. I suggest not leaning too hard on ORMs and frameworks for your database layer.   Good luck and enjoy.   The enjoyment part is more important than people think.  Edit: While learning, it’s imperative that you stay off chatgpt as much as humanly possible."

AskNetsec,1lxykno,Which filters do I use?,F5x9,It’s something you play with when you look at a capture. 
AskNetsec,1lxykno,Which filters do I use?,tha_passi,"Don't forget Client Hello.  But yeah, idk, these filters don't seem very comprehensive and if you really want to make sure you catch everything, you'd have to manually inspect the traffic anyways, which seems more than feasible since it's only one device.  Take a look at some IDS solutions and how they do this or maybe just deploy one instead of handcrafting this."
AskNetsec,1lxykno,Which filters do I use?,Lord_Wither,"Basically, if you want to be sure you find everything out of the ordinary is to go through everything, confirming things as normal along the way and filtering those out until you have either filtered out everything or found something. This is time-consuming and actually determining stuff to be normal can be difficult at times (e.g. searching for a lot of common ad network stuff will end up with a bunch of Google results about ""is this malware?""). At the same time, most communication will be encrypted, so without TLS inspection (basically setting up a MitM proxy), you won't be able to look at what is actually being transmitted over https, which will make it basically impossible to tell what is actually going on inside any potentially interesting connection. To be fair, with a device that isn't actively being used there will be less traffic to look at, so that makes it somewhat easier.  Most malware authors will try to use domains that look as innocuous as possible (or at least be quite random). The chances anyone puts something like ""keylogger"" in the domain for their keylogger is basically zero. For some examples of what actual malware domains look like, have a look at urlhaus, they have a good list."
AskNetsec,1lxykno,Which filters do I use?,Malarazza,"A lot of this comes down to baseline analysis—start with a clean system, monitor typical traffic, and flag anything that deviates. For the encrypted stuff, unless you can do SSL/TLS interception, you’re mostly stuck looking for metadata and unusual destinations. Also, don’t underestimate the usefulness of periodic full packet captures for later review if you spot something odd."

AskNetsec,1lxhdp8,Looking for guidance on designing secure remote access infrastructure (VPN vs ZTNA) for an interview,mikeortega17,"ZTNA solutions can be tricky when they are reverse proxy based, e.g. client to server communication only. A good clarifying question might be if there is a server to client comms requirement as well. If both directions are needed, then you might be looking for a more traditional inline/transparent proxy model like Cato Networks or Palo Prisma.   Clarifying questions might also include understanding the security requirements. Does remote access user traffic need to be inspected for advanced threats or zero days? Again, Cato and Palo Prisma might be good options if the answer is yes since they can do the inspection inline."
AskNetsec,1lxhdp8,Looking for guidance on designing secure remote access infrastructure (VPN vs ZTNA) for an interview,akornato,"You're actually in a solid position here because your endpoint security background gives you the foundation to understand the trust boundaries that matter most in this design. Start with the data flows and user personas - map out who needs access to what, from where, and under what conditions. Your instinct about hybrid VPN with ZTNA features is spot-on for an interview answer because it shows you understand that modern solutions blend approaches rather than forcing a binary choice. Focus on the policy enforcement points and how identity verification happens at each layer, then work outward to the network architecture.  The scaling conversation is where you can really shine by talking about how policies need to adapt as the organization grows, not just the infrastructure capacity. Think about certificate management, policy distribution, and how you'd handle the inevitable edge cases like contractors, partners, or emergency access scenarios. Your firewall and VPN rule experience translates directly to policy engines - it's the same logical thinking applied to identity and device trust instead of just network segments. The interviewers want to see your thought process more than a perfect technical solution, so walk them through your reasoning and acknowledge the tradeoffs you're making.  I'm on the team that built [interview prep AI](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen a lot of people struggle with these system design questions because they get caught up in the technical details instead of demonstrating their problem-solving approach - it might help you practice articulating your reasoning out loud."

The company has a hybrid infra with two offices in two different geo locations in the same country, some resources/workloads in the cloud and a few employees are spread in three international locations (no offices) or just travelling. Seems like a good example to consider since it covers most use cases. 3. I would need to scale this setup at some point eg employee count increases from 1000 to 50k."
AskNetsec,1lxhdp8,Looking for guidance on designing secure remote access infrastructure (VPN vs ZTNA) for an interview,shasha_006,These are some really helpful points that I had not thought of. Thank you! 🤩
AskNetsec,1lxhdp8,Looking for guidance on designing secure remote access infrastructure (VPN vs ZTNA) for an interview,red-joeysh,"OK. I assume (and please correct me if I'm wrong) that this will be a conversation or presentation, and you won't be able to ask questions beforehand. If you can ask some questions before, here are some you may want to ask:  1. What am I designing? Just the access layer? Or, full stack, including identity, AuthZ/N, monitoring, enforcement, etc. 2. BYOD. Supported? Not supported? Managed devices only? (This one is super important) 3. Do we have a threat model to work with? Do we assume a malicious endpoint? compermized creds? 4. Identity management. Do you have something in place? On-prem or SaaS? If SaaS, which is it (Azure AD, Okta, etc.)? The second part isn't crucial. 5. Scaling. What is the coverage now? What is the growth expectancy? 6. Are there any constraints when planning? Budget? Certain vendors? 7. ""Around the world"" with no exceptions? Do I need to enforce locations? (e.g. prevent private VPN before the corporate one, block specific locations, etc.)  There are many other questions, obviously, which you would have asked in a real-world implementation. But asking these questions will show experience, depth, and readiness.  **Next, the VPN vs ZTNA.**  These are very different in approach. While VPN is ""traditional"", it also doesn't scale very well.  ZTNA, on the other hand, is more complex to implement but works well with BYOD, scaling, and a remote workforce.  If you do want to proceed with VPN (it's not a bad idea, don't get me wrong), make sure to consider or implement device compliance, EDR, MDM, etc.  Ask (yourself or them), are remote devices untrusted by nature?  **Next, the network architecture.**  Segment the network. Don't just open up the network to the world (not even through VPN). Consider using bastions as entry points (consider costs, maintenance, licensing).  Consider reverse proxies, SDPs, and identity-aware access gateways.  Decide on split tunnelling or full tunnel. Consider the pros and cons.  Decide on the policy enforcement point. On-prem? In the cloud (edge)? Hybrid?  **Identity, authentication, authorization and granular access (least privileges)**  This part is tied to one of the questions/assumptions we started with. Either determine that there's something already in place, or describe it as part of your implementation.  Prefer centralized IdP (e.g. Google, Okta, Azure AD).  Once you have that, consider (or make decisions) about: MFA, SSO (does your IdP support these?), group mapping (or attribute mapping.  Make sure you map identities across your SaaS and cloud infrastructure (you can use AWS IAM, if on AWS).  Use tags or claims instead of sprawling roles.  Consider using JIT access or temporary access tokens, if possible.  \[To be continued in the following comment\]"
AskNetsec,1lxhdp8,Looking for guidance on designing secure remote access infrastructure (VPN vs ZTNA) for an interview,red-joeysh,"**Logging, monitoring, and incident response**  Make sure everything is logged, including all access requests, authentication requests, failures, etc. Who can see this (in terms of permissions)? Do you have a SIEM?  If you do have SIEM, you need to comply with its standards. If not, use a compatible format (e.g. syslog).  **Geography and latency considerations**  This is a major consideration for the remote workforce. Consider deploying edge servers closer to the users, if possible.  For a SaaS environment, consider using a segmented close-to-home environment (not all SaaS platforms support that).  Make sure you are aware of where your data is. Can you save it there (some regulations prevent data exports to some countries).  **Scalability**  The main pain point for growing organizations.  Make sure each product or infrastructure you choose can scale from your starting 1K to 50K users. What is required for this scale (e.g. just licensing? Extra endpoints? etc.)?  Don't use static ACLs; these don't scale well. Use tag-based and/or identity-attribute access models instead.  When and wherever possible, use cloud native infrastructure (e.g. serverless proxies).    This is a kinda brain dump. You obviously don't need to implement all of this. But make sure you have an opinion about most of the points and can voice that opinion in confidence.  Whenever you make an assumption (and you should make as many as you can), document it, and consider the possibility that your assumption is wrong. Try to have a fallback for each assumption.  While on your interview, don't worry if your assumptions fail. Don't be afraid to say ""I will have to redesign this part"" or ""I didn't plan for that, but I will figure out a solution"".  Good luck."

The point is that if Bob didn't even know Alice but had e.g. bought her stolen credentials on the dark web he could get past Xeno's MFA because it doesn't care that the authenticator app doesn't belong to Alice.   I guess anyone with a Xeno account could test this for themselves.
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,jstumbles,I don't know: it's what happened when my partner and I did it yesterday!
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,jstumbles,"I'm not trying to prove that MFA itself is security theatre, but it seems to me this implementation is defective and I want to ask people who know more than I do about this (which is probably everyone here!) if I am right in my analysis of this implementation or if I am missing something.       Shouldn't Bob's authenticator app have to be trusted by Alice before he can access her Xero account? That's something that Bob wouldn't be able to do if he only knew Alice's username+passwd so it genuinely would be more secure than a simple login."
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,jstumbles,"My partner did not already have MFA set up - that's how we discovered this.   I don't understand what you mean by ""Any sanely implemented MFA system would never let Carol get access to the MFA setup with just a username and password"" - I thought MFA was supposed to be an extra check after the user had provided username & password credentials"
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,operationWGAFA,If your MFA doesn’t have multiple ways to authenticate you’ve built a poor product.
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,darkmemory,"You missed the point. If a user gives away access to their credentials, any security granted by those credentials is effectively useless.   If you make copies of your house keys and give them away to people, it shouldn't be shocking that they can unlock your door.   I will grant you that in terms of something important like a paycheck, there should be some type of allowance to interact with the software, or the employer should be required to enable some other means of getting one's pay, but that does not suddenly make MFA theatre."
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,jstumbles,I realised I made a complete hash of my OP - sorry.   I've changed it to hopefully make sense now.
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,skylinesora,It's not that the implementation is defective. You have users sharing credentials and using other people devices for MFA. Your example itself is a failure because it in itself is a security failure. You can't blame that on MFA. You can blame that on your crappy example.
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,Psybunny,Sounds like first time setup. Have you tried logging in again? Most likely you’ll see and understand that Alice’s account is now connected to your device and QR code won’t we displayed again and it’ll ask for a confirmation code from your device instead.
AskNetsec,1lupk43,MFA - security theatre?,rexstuff1,"Right. BUT. If MFA is already set up, then Carol would not be able to access the MFA settings *without first authenticating with MFA*. You can try this yourself on your partner's account.  And if MFA is not set up, then Carol can login with username+password, no MFA required. So why would she bother trying to get the MFA configured, she's already in the account?  Now, once auth'd via username+password, could Carol then configure MFA, and thereby lock you out of your account? Sure. But she could also do that just be changing the password."
AskNetsec,1ltm58k,Netcat listener is not working,Xeteskian,"It is possible, but in my experience, a real pita.  You have to use netsh to set up a port proxy on the windows machine running wsl.  I.can’t remember the syntax and have to google it every time (Google “port forward on wsl”). Tbh, you’d be better off installing kali as a vm with bridged networking over using wsl.  Wsl is great for local dev, not so great when you want to use it for hosting a listening service on a network.  I hate having extra layers of abstraction between my the target and my listener because it becomes harder to troubleshoot what’s going wrong."
AskNetsec,1ltm58k,Netcat listener is not working,kappadoky,"If it's not a firewall issue, than maybe it's an issue with your IP? Are you using a VPN? Because then you should use the tun interface (usually tun0).   Are you running the listener as root?  Also, are you hosting the webshell on a webserver of yours (like for a RFI)? Because then make sure your server doesn't interpret the php (by renaming it or by disabling php module)"

I'm sure it is *possible*.  > or some kind of abstraction is in place to block the listener inside WSL that's stopping it from picking up the connection and the connection is only reaching till WSL Host Machine and not WSL?  Probably! Windows networking + WSL is a hot mess, it could be a number of things.  I would echo the sentiment of the others: ditch WSL and get yourself a proper VM. Theres nothing worse than trying to learn a new skill while having to fight your tools the entire time."

Honestly I know I have to use a proper Kali installation than this WSL, for some reason I'm just pushing it forward rather than doing it. I am new to this, I've started learning Cyber Security and related tools like 4 months ago to move to this domain, everything from nmap to metasploit to empire Powershell is working fine and I did not go ahead with a full blown linux installation.

AskNetsec,1ltm58k,Netcat listener is not working,fLuFFYMAn70-1,"I'm in the process of setting those up.  In the meantime somehow I got the mindset to debug this nonsense.   Finally found the issue yay!  Thanks for all your support, somehow it pushed me to find the root cause.   The problem was the host IP, I tried the WSL Kali's IP and Windows WSL Host's IP, the issue was in this actually, now I tried the VPN IP that's assigned to me by Open VPN which we use to connect to THM network. In addition to the usual opening the port on firewall and port proxy via netsh on Powershell and listener still on Kali, received the connection.   Yes, I know, as I had said it's my mistake which I was decently sure, was just debugging in the wrong place (WSL and Windows Host Network Architecture/Limitations) but it was the IP technically that was wrong."
AskNetsec,1ltm58k,Netcat listener is not working,fLuFFYMAn70-1,"Yes I uploaded the payload directly, there was a hidden endpoint in the webserver which was an easy find with a directory bruteforcing which offers upload functionality and another endpoint which lists all the uploaded files.   Yes, now I'm seriously considering using proper Kali since I have kinda touched the ceiling of WSL on the kind of tools and usecases I'm dealing with in my learnings at this point it's just adding unnecessary headaches and affecting my learning as well trying to fix this, maybe I'll do mountable boot on a SSD or something, I have a decently powerful machine and I don't want to dual boot and split the existing drives. Is that fine? Do you have any other suggestions for this?"

AskNetsec,1lt22ux,Why people don’t mention ONTs (Networking infrastructure overall)?,enigmaunbound,I suspect that it's because ONTs usually are not user configurable.  They pull config from the upstream device.  I worked for a telecom and you would be appalled at the industries lack of cyber security care.  So much of the threat models are based on obscurity and a belief that Telco infrastructure is physically protected.

Networking is a huge field. ""learn networking"" could mean learning about how the OS (windows, Linux, etc) does things. Or it could mean campus networks. Or it could mean ISP networks. Or it could mean home networks.  Each of those ""specialities"" focus on different things.   Also, in the US, the vast majority of people have cable internet. Some have DSL. Some have fiber. Some have satellite. Some have a wireless setup (not in-home wireless, but [wireless WAN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_WAN)).   This means that the equipment that interfaces with your provider (cable modem, ONT, etc) depends on your service. Since you generally can't control or configure this anyway, it makes no sense to dig into the details, unless it pertains to you.  But *every* network has routers, firewalls, switches, etc. Regardless of your ISP/service type.  If you need to learn about ONTs, there are resources. But it doesn't make sense to teach them to *everyone*."
AskNetsec,1lt22ux,Why people don’t mention ONTs (Networking infrastructure overall)?,alecmuffett,"I am in the UK and I can only take a wild guess that this relates to the US having a really weird relationship towards broadband networking, partially as a consequence of the US history of telephone monopoly, monopoly break up and alternatives over there.   Again, I have no firm evidence that I can offer for this, but basically broadband provision in the USA came as a side effect of Cable TV rather than phone service or wholesale separate infrastructure. I think this helped create a unique (branded) mindset in the US."

AskNetsec,1lt22ux,Why people don’t mention ONTs (Networking infrastructure overall)?,rankinrez,"The regulations are different, resulting in most places only having one option for broadband service provider.  That’s because it’s long been run by private companies (even though many were in a monopoly position).  Unlike the UK/Europe where former state monopolies got privatised after the 1980s - with the rule that they had to provide wholesale access to their last mile networks.  The US couldn’t really impose such requirements on private phone/cable companies by the time the internet came around.   But anyway they have/had DSL in the US, as well as DOCSIS and PON etc.  it’s not true to say they only had cable."
AskNetsec,1lt22ux,Why people don’t mention ONTs (Networking infrastructure overall)?,enigmaunbound, I haven't seen any good breakdown.   I have concerns but it's the same concern as any other network.  Telco are human Institutions. The most information I've run into about ONT's looking into replacing my ATT ONT with an SFP that is programmable.  You can remove the dedicated ONT and use your own routers.  It would be interesting to see what you can reverse engineer from the CPE perspective of the upstream equipment .  It would be an interesting field of study and experimenting.

AskNetsec,1lt22ux,Why people don’t mention ONTs (Networking infrastructure overall)?,NihilisticAngst,"Consider, it's a lot easier for foreign countries who developed their telecom infrastructure after the U.S. to learn from the lessons U.S. companies did and immediately develop their infrastructure to be more modernized. The US is massive and everything is really far apart, so it is a massive expense to replace everything with fiber when it was already so expensive to install the older infrastructure and there might not be enough demand for change, especially in rural communities because people in those communities don't necessarily want to spend more or have the extra money to spend. Thus, the U.S. has a ton of legacy infrastructure when it comes to telecom because it's much too expensive to upgrade it for everywhere. So, what you will tend to see is that newer, and/or more populous US cities and higher income areas will have had their infrastructure overhauled already and people can access cutting edge fiber technologies and high speeds (usually 1/2 gbps max for consumer fiber) with stuff like ONTs. While places without much economic growth or very rural places tend to still be stuck on older systems like Cable internet or even DSL (using the preexisting phone lines).  The terminology can also get a bit confusing because of how the infrastructure seems to be progressing (at least in the US). I know that US ISPs with fiber infrastructure like AT&T used to have wall mounted ONTs that would then have an Ethernet cable that runs to the router/gateway, but now they're moving to gateways that have the ONT built in. And thus to the customers, the ""ONT""  and the ""router"" are now basically the same thing."
AskNetsec,1lt22ux,Why people don’t mention ONTs (Networking infrastructure overall)?,dariusbiggs,"You would think that but no, the best description I've heard is that it's a third world country posing as a first world one.

cybersecurity,1mmy5ey,"Mentorship Monday - Post All Career, Education and Job questions here!",coaliselieu,"Hey everyone,  I’m looking for some clarity and guidance on making a solid plan to break into cybersecurity. A bit about me: I have a high school qualification in Computer Science (pretty broad, I know) and completed a two-year vocational college program in iOS and Android development. Despite this, it’s been a year since I graduated and I haven’t been able to land an IT job. I got far in one interview but was rejected due to lack of experience. For the past 10 years, I’ve worked as a nursing assistant to pay the bills.  After applying to hundreds of jobs and feeling discouraged, I decided to explore something new. I’d always been curious about cybersecurity, so I started following TryHackMe’s roadmap, beginning with Pre-Security and working through Cybersecurity 101, Junior Penetration Testing, TryHackMe’s own certificate, Web Fundamentals 101, Web Application Pentesting, and Red Teaming. That roadmap could take between six months to a year. I absolutely fell in love with it. I’ve really enjoyed learning everything so far, especially the more practical and hands on stuff, and now I know I definitely want to pursue pen testing, and eventually red teaming.  I’ve been documenting my progress with detailed notes and write-ups on GitHub, but I want to be realistic. I understand it’s unlikely to land an offensive security role right away without experience and certifications. What I’m uncertain about is when and which certifications I should focus on first. TryHackMe offers a certificate, but I’ve heard it’s not very widely recognized.  Does anyone have advice on whether I should take a break from the roadmap to pursue certifications and try to get an entry-level IT job once I finish the Cybersecurity 101 module? Or should I push through the entire roadmap, and then try getting certs/work? I’m ready to dedicate a few hours every day and want to be strategic about it.  I'm not looking to find an easy way in, and I won’t skip over the hard work. If it needs to be done and it means I can eventually find myself a job in this area, I'm wiling to do it.   Thanks!"

I started uni at 19 with computer engineering to then eventually do cybersecurity and i left after a year because i didn't like it. I have Always had a passion for technology and i still do, but I wasn't doing well mentally, to the point where I seriously hated coding because I went crazy when i couldn't find a solution, and it would cause me a lot of anger. But especially, what made me drop was that when i eventually managed to find the solution I didn't feel good at all.  So i switched career and started psychology, got my degree and i'm currently doing the masters degree in Neuroscience. I'm having some troubles again, but it's been a couple of years since i have been confused on my future career. So i am not saying I want to switch back to cybersecurity, I am just considering it. So what should the next step be? Are there ways to avoid getting another degree?  And eventually speaking, career wise, what kind of joba are there? I could consider getting into therapy school and working both as a therapist and in this field. Is It doable? I am also open to move abroad, actually even better if i can, but always in Europe."

I have worked my first year as a Technical Account Manager for a Gartner SSE leader which basically comes under the umbrella of support. I was naive and thought this is not what cyber is and left the organization still being my biggest regret.   Then, joined the other org thinking let's do dev but didn't like it and within a week changed my project to CyberSec but ultimately ended up working as Deploying the same SSE tool for various clients in this new service based org.   Now, I do have this experience on that particular SSE tool but my mind says what next? I'm planning to resign from here. This is definitely cyber and rather a full cycle from design till handover which I've done for multiple clients now but I feel this is not enough to land me a job further. When I see the openings, I see the required skills and they aren't what I've worked extensively but rather minimally.

I've interviewed hundreds of people in my career, including for current cybersecurity roles both senior and junior. Currently working for a large tech company, located in a tech hub. Based on that, here are some thoughts...  >Getting a BS and security + will not land you a job in cybersecurity.  Obtaining a degree doesn't guarantee a job. Though there are several jobs I can guarantee you will not get without a degree. In my experience, there are a couple things people miss when earning a degree. 1) They often get the wrong degree, one that is meant to be specialized (but oddly not specialized enough). Either go very (very, very) deep, or go wide. 2) We only get to play the ""student card"" while in school, which means: Lining-up an internship, developing the start of a professional network, and working on soft skills. These are critical elements often overlooked,  >Experience is the most valuable currency in any IT role above all.  Specifically, the right sort of experience that shows progressive skills development. It isn't just technical skills we look for. How well someone works within a team, treat customers, and make a positive contribution are all part of the work experience. These elements also get overlooked far too frequently. Any job is better than no job, but a job well done is what sets people apart.  >If you have zero experience in IT field, start applying to helpdesk.   That is one good place to start. Though, I can offer dozens of examples of staff that started in roles like sales, technical support, customer service, training, contracting, software engineering, and more. Previous careers can also be a plus such as military service, legal, and even creative roles. In fact, I think helpdesk might be the least likely starting point for our current cybersecurity staff (over 200 people).  >Be prepared to apply to 60\~80 jobs per day for next 6 months straight.   Right now it is indeed important to apply generously. However, one thing that is an overwhelming trend amongst recent successful candidates is the size and quality of their professional network. They did not apply to 60+ jobs a day. They applied to 3 or 4 jobs a day, but they placed those applications well. They contacted staff within their network who work at the company to obtain an internal recommendation. They did their research and found out which skills were actually desirable (the stuff not printed in the job description). They put real energy into targeting specific roles. What almost all of them did, unsurprisingly, was bypass the traditional HR recruiting process. Whether someone goes for quantity over quality is ultimately their call, though right now the quality folks appear to be landing the majority of roles."

cybersecurity,1mmy5ey,"Mentorship Monday - Post All Career, Education and Job questions here!",fabledparable,"> I am about to graduate highschool and was wondering if it was possible to get straight into an actual cybersecurity job  I would anticipate an extraordinarily challenging job hunt.  One of the biggest challenges you'll be grappling is your lack of credentials. Chiefly: the absence of a pertinent work history. [While there are approaches into the industry that don't involve a college degree](https://bytebreach.com/posts/do-i-need-a-degree/), they typically lean on other forms of leverage that you don't have.  If university is not accessible to you, you're probably looking at either:  * *Years* of cyber-adjacent employment, likely starting at the lowest rungs of the IT hierarchy (e.g. the Helpdesk). * Military service  > I really want to avoid college if possible since to get my associates I have to do a bunch of bs core classes I really don't wanna do.  While I understand that college isn't for everyone, I will note that this decision introduces long-term risks to your career. Put another way: *every* time you go job hunting, the lack of a degree puts you categorically in a challenging position against the many other applicants who *will* have their degree. This will happen whether you're looking for a change of employment voluntarily or involuntarily (i.e. layoffs, firings, downsizing, etc.). It will be especially perilous if you later decide you want to pivot out of cybersecurity altogether.  Also note that just because you have the ability to go to college *now* does not mean that opportunity will always be on the table *later*. As you age, life will introduce all kinds of blockers to impede your ability to return to academia: disability, income dependency, work schedules, elder care, etc. Likewise, the harder academic subjects (e.g. mathematics) do not age well in your mind with time; anecdotally, I had a decade-long gap between when I did my undergraduate degree and my graduate degree - jumping back into collegiate calculus after having not looked at it for 10 years was *rough*.  I recognize I'm preaching a bit here, but my concern stems from the fact that it seems you're considering avoiding college not because you have some other worthwhile opportunity, but because you just don't want to. That - on its face - seems a touch reckless."

cybersecurity,1mp6545,Do we still need XDR if we already have a strong SIEM?,kiakosan,"From what I understand (it's been a little since I've looked) XDR is mostly EDR with marketing. Siem is more of log aggression, alert generation from different sources, and SOAR is for automating responses for things like alerts you get in the siem. Many siems these days have SOAR functionality, and certain EDR/XDR tools can have some siem like functionality.   I would argue that you need some sort of EDR even if you have a strong siem, as the EDR is the first line of defense for things like endpoints. A SIEM is great for making a single pane of glass and detecting more complex attacks along the attack lifecycle, but you should still have something on the endpoint to protect the device immediately from known threats and common exploits.   I believe that the issue is that many companies make products that are blurring the lines. Take for example Microsoft defender XDR, it is advertised as an XDR product, but it also can ingest and correlate data with multiple other services (defender for identity, cloud apps etc) and it directly integrates with sentinel which is itself a combination siem/soar. With that being said, if you don't have any EDR on your endpoint, a SIEM is limited as something needs to be able to isolate the computer or quarantine files etc, but you could get away without a SIEM, it would just be a lot harder"

Do you have another tool that enables you to quickly and effectively isolate machines for containment?  Do you have another tool that provides your incident responders a quick way to gain access to and research/respond to a compromised machine? Can they do that while the device is isolated?  Do you have a way to quickly and efficiently pull incident artifacts or forensics packages from a machine?  Are you already pulling all the logs and telemetry separately that an XDR platform could possibly just forward to your SIEM?  Do you have a 24/7 SOC with quick occurrence to response times? Is your SIEM shooting out alerts fast enough to allow for a quick response time?  Is your SIEM alerting rules being updated regularly to find all current threats?

cybersecurity,1mp6545,Do we still need XDR if we already have a strong SIEM?,sn0b4ll,"Exactly this, first AV was the hot shit, then EDR as a term was invented because everyone had an AV already. As everyone now has an EDR, you need something new to sell and so XDR was invented.. sorry if I am being a bit cynical, but it's hard to fight against the ever changing marketing bullshit terms.  And no I do not say that you don't need an XDR/EDR/AV in addition to your SIEM. The SIEM Is the central correlation and alerting, EDR is your endpoint first line of defense, as it is IDS/IPs for network for example."
cybersecurity,1mp6545,Do we still need XDR if we already have a strong SIEM?,VS-Trend,"depends what vendor you're talking to.  EDR will give you the OS level killchain, XDR will also connect  network, email, identity, containers, and whatever else telemetry it has"

XDR is an EDR with more data collection and telemetry capabilities but both include the Prevention and Active response system with the 3 primary actions : Isolate ( cut network of the host ), Pause process, Kill process chain.

cybersecurity,1mp6545,Do we still need XDR if we already have a strong SIEM?,MemeOps,"While you have a certain amount of a point, in practice xdr is usually defined as extending detection solutions to things like e-mail security, identity protection on prem and in azure, cloud security such as detections around cloud workloads, network detection etc, rather than edr which is basically just a sensor on a workstation or server.   Understanding that xdr just means holistic protection outside of just endpoints makes the terms highly relevant and useful"
cybersecurity,1mp6545,Do we still need XDR if we already have a strong SIEM?,kiakosan,"Yeah in reality most of these cyber products tend to blur the lines a bit, and the definitions seem to change based on who is selling the product. For instance Sophos has a product they market as an XDR while also selling an NDR  product. In my opinion a true XDR would be able to take some of that telemetry as well as other signals like email. To my knowledge I don't think it does (or did it's been a while) all of that whereas a product like defender or CS does.   I think that these acronyms were created specifically to confuse people and get CISOs to spend more money on products they might not actually need/overlaps with existing tools.   For example with MDR you can have things like Arctic Wolf that take whatever logs you can feed it and they more or less escalate alerts to you from the various sources with not a whole lot of analysis to things like Sophos MDR where they mostly take in logs from their products which you need to have and then they do a decent job of explaining the alerts and taking action. Then you have others which are basically SOC as a service that you can give them pretty much any log from your siem and they handle most T1 type work.   The industry needs to create definitions for different types of these products. MDR that also has siem like functions but minimal analysis and limited response, good for a very small security team? Give it a name. MDR that actually does a ton of analysis and wide variety of responses specifically for things with their agents or appliances? Call it managed XDR. MDR that you basically pipe things from your environment to them with your siem and they handle basic security tasks? Call it SOC as a service.   EDR/XDR is similar. If it's just endpoint logs and nothing else it should be EDR. if it's network logs as well EDR+XDR. If it's both of those plus servers plus network plus email security then it should be XDR. these are just some examples, but the naming conventions make it difficult to compare products when trying to get a new one."

cybersecurity,1mp3i10,New ATT&CK Tool for Threat Actor Attribution,d_stroid,"As a research tool, this might be useful, but calling it an ""attribution tool"" is misleading for multiple reasons. Here are two that immediately come to my mind: 1. Attribution involves more than just TTPs. 2. Your tool just correlates ATT&CK Techniques, but does not take the info into account, how a TTP was used.  In CTI, one of the most common model for attribution is the diamond model which consists of four major areas: adversary, victimology, infrastructure, capability. The diamond model is used to summarize information about threat actors and match these information against your observed incidents.  Some vendors use their very own methods of clustering and attributing activities, e.g. Mandiant/Google: https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/clustering-and-associating-attacker-activity-at-scale/"

cybersecurity,1mp3i10,New ATT&CK Tool for Threat Actor Attribution,dm987,"Of course.... this is just one tool among many to conduct attribution.  The Diamond Model (which I have taught for nearly a decade) is a CTI tool.... my contribution here is a threat hunting tool.  Attribution in threat hunting is first and foremost meant to assist hunters in finding a ""map"" on where to look next for actor activities.  This tool is built for that singular purpose."
cybersecurity,1mp3i10,New ATT&CK Tool for Threat Actor Attribution,dm987,"You mean the ability to get a ""top 10"" likely threat actors from just coloring a few cells?  where and how?"
cybersecurity,1mp3i10,New ATT&CK Tool for Threat Actor Attribution,d_stroid,"What if you have in fact two adversaries in your environment and since no CTI analyst is there to distinguish these activities, you just toss it all into the same bucket and let you attribution tool guess who that could be... If you're lucky, your tool gets at least one of the threat actors right, but completely misses the second one.  There is a reason why there are different roles. Threat hunters hunt for threats. Once they find anything, they open an incident which is handled by incident responders and forensics analysts. All of them will probably work closely with CTI anylsts whose domain is knowledge about threat actors and attribution. Obviously, there are some feedback loops between different roles."

cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,cookiengineer,"> 4: Homelab  Kind of funny given that most recruitement processes don't even bother to check GitHub accounts and the personal projects there.  I get your take, I really do.  But you won't even get to the point meeting the people that care about cyber related topics that much, actually, because they're filtered out before in the process already.  You want me to enter my CV and previous employers in your shitty SAP success factors page and expect me to do that for over 45 minutes? Guess what, 99% of people that are talented are already gone by that point.  You want me to answer to a generic message that you wrote with an AI tool yourself to literally hundreds at once because you keep landing in Spam folders because of that, but expect me to respond with a thorough message with integrity to something that gives zero feedback or critique to my application? Guess what, most candidates that care about ethics are gone by that point already.  - - -  If you really want people that care about things, you need to start caring about the recruitment process. If you come up with excuses that the ""higher ups decided on that"" then guess what, you won't find people that care about cyber security. And if you keep hiring people because your whole HR department doesn't know the difference between Java and JavaScript, which takes literally less than 10 seconds with asking ChatGPT once, then you won't even find devs that can fix your software issues.  HR is absolutely botched, intransparent, and benefits only the ones automating at scale. And these are either consultancy agencies that bleed your organizations dry - well, or foreign APTs.  You have to change the game, man, because the rules don't benefit the people that you want in your organization. Organize cyber security meetups, organize developer meetups, help contribute to open source projects. Then you get at least the people that care about these issues.  Just my two cents, as a vendor who ditched the whole HR external agency shitshow that gives me exactly 100% of the wrong candidates, because HR agencies don''t give a damn about anything anymore."
cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Consistent-Law9339,"You should be aware that this is YOUR advice for how to get YOU to look at a resume. It doesn't apply to every hiring manager, and pitching it without disclaimer shows a lack of awareness.  You also failed to explain how 24 resumes end up in your pile. What's the filtering process? How do applicants get past your HR filter or ATS?  The vast majority of hiring managers I've talked to do not recommend using header or column coloring, instead they recommend a plain white resume with the following structure: contact info > skills > experience > certifications > education.  ---  For 5 years, I worked for a school that assisted veterans with transitioning from military to IT. We had weekly workshops that were hosted by industry personnel ranging from hiring managers, HR staff, 3rd party recruiters, staffing agencies, executives, owners, etc.  I sat through hundreds of those meetings. Every host provided different advice. Generally their advice was specific to their own preference or some standard within the specific industry area they worked in, for example Clearance jobs generally want more detail and more pages (5pgs is not uncommon).  Some want 6pg resumes with excessive detail. Some want 2pg resumes with summary bullet points. Some want 2pg resumes with detailed info. Some want 1pg and nothing more. Some advise including a headshot. Some say their ATS resume processing system gets borked if you include images. Some want cover letters. Some don't. Some say do whatever you can to game the filter (hidden text). Others say they flag gaming.  This was advice given to veterans looking for jobs, not specifically advice on how to get hired at the host's company.  There is no one size fits all ""best advice"" for resume crafting. Whatever perfect resume you craft will be discarded without getting any eyeballs on it at some places, simply because the HR staff has crafted some personal filtering into their workflow.  With that being said, I don't think its worth the effort to tune different resumes for different companies, unless you have inside information (recruiter, or staff) giving you tips on how to tune.  My personal advice is to follow the guidelines from the [EngineeringResumes](https://old.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/) subreddit.  If you have <10 YOE try keep your resume to 1pg.  If you have >=10 YOE keep it to 2pgs or less.  ---  Additionally, don't include your phone number or physical address on your resume. Include your Linkedin, email, and Github or whatever. There are tons of scam job postings that are just harvesting PII info from resumes. Any real company that is interested will put in the effort to contact you on LinkedIn or via email.  If you receive an email for a position, look at the email sender's domain. Run a whois lookup on the domain via [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/en). If the domain was registered recently, it's 100% a scam. Tons of scammers are using domain formats like ""careers-company.com"" or ""jobs-company.com"" or ""hr-company.com"". ""company"" in these examples would be replaced with the company's official domain name, like ""pepsi"" or ""bestbuy"".  It takes effort, but if you see a posting you are really interested in on a site like LinkedIn, check the company's official careers page to confirm the post before you apply. LinkedIn and all the other job boards do not verify the postings.  ---  The actual issue with getting hired right now is the economy and job market are fucked. For anyone with no experience, and a recently obtained degree, my advice is to plan on working outside of your degree field for a few years while you apply on the side and hope the economy and job market gets better. It's not getting better right now. It's getting worse.  [The IT job market has lost over 135,100 jobs since April 2024](https://e-janco.com/press/2025/2025-05-02-April-it-job-market-shrinks-in-q1.html). That's 135k people with experience who are competing for the very few open positions. I'm one of them. I have 15+ YoE, and tons of certifications. I was laid off in January due to EDU and Veteran Benefits funding cuts. Since January, I've applied to thousands of jobs. I've had a hand full of interviews. For comparison, prior to this, in all of my previous experience I've never applied to more than 30 postings without landing a job. I'm applying to positions well below my skill level and pay grade, and I'm getting no response. I've had internal references set me up with recommendations and gone through multiple rounds of interviews only to be rug pulled at the end due to ""hiring freeze"".  This [graph](https://imgur.com/JBSvrM8) shows the cumulative loss. It's pretty clear when things went south: Nov 2024, right after the presidential election. There was uncertainty for a bit, things got a little better, and then worse, and then a little better again, but we've been in a steady decline since April 2025.  This [graph](https://imgur.com/RlXky4M) shows the monthly IT jobs created/lost. Numbers in parenthesis are negative.  Look at the past 4 months:   Apr-25 600   May-25 (4,300)   Jun-25 (9,300)   July-25 (10,300)  The trend is getting worse, not better. 600 new jobs in April. 4300 lost jobs in May. 9300 lost jobs in June. 10300 lost jobs in July.  No amount of resume tuning or homelabing is going to overcome this issue. Does that mean you shouldn't put time and effort into improving your odds? No, you should, but just be realistic about it. The economy and job market are FUCKED. It is very unlikely that you are going to land a job in the current market without experience, because you are competing with ~130k people who have experience. Be realistic, plan on working outside of your degree field, apply on the side, and hope the economy and job market get better."

Got told in an interview (with respect) that I can talk the talk, but I don't have the war stories nor the resume to back it up. Apart from a couple of years out, I've worked the same SMB for 10 years. I do admit, when you've been so long at a job, it all blends together, so the resume does look a little thin on impact. The ""responsible for vulnerability management = I enabled patching in the RMM"" situation. Big impact for the business, but not going to impress an enterprise.   I can list a million small things, but no heavy hitters. Everything's just easier and less impactful in an SMB, even if it's just as important.

cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Puzzled_Ruin9027,"Spot on. I do feel junior role seekers get steered wrongly by inexperienced headhunters way too often.   My most shocking experience was seeing the printed resume a manager brought in that looked nothing like mine; stripped to be cookie cutter format.  I do think a last page of keywords is helpful, I don't expect anyone technical to read it, it's there for the sorting hat and HR to check their boxes from the role's responsibilities list.   As a junior role seeker out of college (long long ago) I already had multiple IT jobs under my belt, not the same caliber as the meat in the first two pages; it was always a debate with the recruiter about removing it and always a question from round 1 on why I kept it.   It showed growth and ambition even if it was an admin or data entry role that ended up owning the local office tech scutt. Most of all I included funny/sarcastic shortening of what that role long ago really was with a silver lining.  Eg:  It took 6 months to convince the owner it was crucial to use encrypted services that didn't show clear text passwords that gave HR palpitations due to their indecency and another 6 to haggle terms of contracts with business and vendor because IT expenditure was wasted capital.  Or: Worked in the printer room. Eg: Someone had to get the printers upgraded to hardware that supported security end to end to protect confidential paperwork (ahem:  adult site printouts) often seen from upper management queues.   Most people never read past the first 2 pages, but the interviews with those that did were truly fun and some of the better roles I'd accepted."

cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Jairlyn,Fair question. I think Phrasing is key and when someone is using phrases and terms out of context it hints they dont have the experience backing up their words.   E.g. I agree with you that vulnerability management is more than pushing out patches. Designed or built a solution is impressive for sure.   Inexperience to me is that they add in the # of devices they patched in the above example. Through automation it doesn’t really matter if it’s 10 or a thousands. The key word of responsible for means someone told them to operate an existing solution and process. That was what I was trying to go for in my example above.   It’s worth mentioning that this by itself or most things by themselves on my list arent a red flag causing a resume to be deleted. It just a negative contributor to a final quick decision.
cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Jairlyn,"That’s a good question and to be honest, I have never asked that in all my years.  I think I am the oddball that I am less interested in the format and style vs what they thought of and what went into their design.   To answer your question. I would be impressed if you did any documentation and that you used a tool as it shows you are aware of the importance of it. I’ve always felt managers can teach specific skills and tools but we can’t teach someone to want to try. Above all else, that is what I am looking for."
cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Jairlyn,If you put homelab on your resume you need to be prepared to speak to it in an interview.  You can’t have just played around with it. You need to demonstrate  1: the design decisions of why you selected tool XYZ and not others.  2: what errors your encountered and how you overcame them.   I remember one interview long ago. This person had a homelab. It had a windows DC by they couldn’t get it to work. They had an email server they are meaning to finish but never did. In my mind it killed the interview because it showed they gave up and didn’t put in the time. It would have been better if they never brought it up.   Wiping and starting over is perfectly fine. Learn and improve. I lost count of how many times I locked myself out of a pfsense firewall lol.

Its not a show stopper for me because this only really happens with new people and they just don't have stand out other things to highlight.  A resume's only purpose is to get an interview. IMO the interview is what gets you the job. A project section is fine if it adds and doesn't take away.   Adds: You don't have much job experience and need to add something applicable to the posted job requirements.   Takes Away: If you spend too much page space on your projects and less work experience."
cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Jairlyn,IMO just a simple line stating you have one and maybe a key app or two. Many people wont care about a homelab so don't make it a stand out section of your resume because work experience > homelab. A homelab is the little bit to push your resume tipping towards getting a call for an interview. Placement would be in the non work experience other section where education and certs go. Maybe drop it in as a keyword at the very top of skills that would be used to hopefully get your resume past HR screening software.

cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Jairlyn,"A few extra pages for a senior position makes sense. I think the deciding factor is, does the additional information add value to telling the story of why I need to interview this person. For a senior role it certainly would because what is needed for that is less and education and more experience. There is an old expression that I find applicable the more I rise the corporate ladder ""You get paid less for what you do and more for what you know."" Not college degree knowledge but the trial by fire ""your server just died and backups failed and that millionaire client is calling for status kind of knowledge"" type."

I would have already listed that in the job req as part of the job so the assumption is your homelab needs something else to showcase your skills and planning because you don’t have the exact experience I am needing.   That is part of the point. When not given a list of requirements, what do you think should be in a homelab. What was your methodology for selecting the tools you chose. How far did you take your homelab. What did you take into consideration or not even think about. When you encountered errors and problems how did you overcome them.   Be prepared for questions on your homelab. For entry level jobs I am interested in how you think. Skills can be taught. What can’t be taught is (1) care enough to mentally show up. It’s sad how many people don’t. (2) can you learn. Again it’s sad how many can’t. They need a checklist for everything and expect to be trained on everything.

I must have google resume styles way back in the day and just kept it. Education at the very end though. For me, education only matters for meeting an HR roadblock that I have to have someone with a college degree.

cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Jairlyn,"It was the route I took. Back then when I started as a sys admin, companies would hire computer nerds because there weren't really established college degrees and certainly no certs. At that point my experience carried a lot of weight that the transition to cyber was easy. Also when I transitioned, it was a much thinner line between sys admin and cyber. Role separation wasn't as important in my personal experience as much as just doubling up to save labor $ and have IT do it all.   Its a different time and place today and us old folk need to keep in mind what worked for us won't necessarily work for people starting out. Things are much more specialized and I would say advanced or maybe more mature?   My unsolicited advice: Lean in on your strengths of experience as a sys admin in what it offers for cyber. You know the underlying technology you are protecting. You also know the impact to the user and customer if cyber goes overboard with locking things down too much. Too many cyber folk have this idea that they are the end all be all and cyber > everything else. Company able to complete its mission > cyber. Us managers love it when we learn that our employees know our struggles."
cybersecurity,1mo5pmc,What I look for in a resume,Jairlyn,Sure you could do it. You have to lean in on your strengths. You’ve audited IT for 10 years.

cybersecurity,1mpbb2c,Increased effectiveness of hardware keys,neutronburst,Username+ hardware token and pin for passwordless login along with SSO would be my go to.
cybersecurity,1mpbb2c,Increased effectiveness of hardware keys,cheese-demon,"hardware tokens are largely phishing-resistant more than anything, since a non-compromised webauthn client will verify the relying party hostname before passing the request to the authenticator. these days most anything that supports passkeys will also support hardware tokens as well.  TOTP authenticators and SMS are not the same, but outside of targeted attacks can be equivalent. they can be phished is the main weakness. i personally don't like SMS as an authenticator due to weaknesses like SIM hijacking, but to be honest it's a little overly paranoid as you're being deliberately targeted there rather than phished.  ultimately you have to perform a threat assessment for yourself and consider what level of security works best for you, and look at the specific places each kind of extra authenticator improves (or doesn't) security.  just a password is phishable and unlimited in time. sms or totp are phishable but limited in time; sms is considered less secure because it's relatively easy to hijack in a targeted attack. email is phishable and time-limited but subject to how well secured your email is. hardware keys are phishing-resistant and localized in place. passkeys are phishing-resistant but not necessarily localized.  while i use my hardware keys wherever possible, either directly or via SSO to an IdP that supports the keys, it's a hard thing to recommend to people generally. most accounts you're using them for won't have a fast or easy way to recover an account where you lose or get locked out of the key, which is important to keep in mind as that account may be rendered useless either long enough to be annoying or even permanently.  for business employees, there's usually an internal team that can assist in regaining access when locked out like that. it's a pretty easy decision for me, make phishing extremely difficult while not adding much support burden."

cybersecurity,1mpabxh,Security in a coworking office,evilwon12,My first two questions -  How is Defender setup / is it setup properly? Do they have MFA enabled and working - and for what?  You’re never going to be able to lock down that network so look at ensuring the users are locked down and the endpoints are protected. A sidebar with that is alerting.
cybersecurity,1mpabxh,Security in a coworking office,LonelyTacoRider,"Out the top of my head, I'd set up Defender EDR, MDCA and make sure sharepoint, teams etc are covered.  In scenarios where it's harder to control your perimeter, the priority is protecting your endpoints first with zero trust mentality. Even if you had a local network, it wouldn't guarantee security and it may even make it worse because of complacency and trust issues. Threats will most likely be coming from phishing emails, infected USB keys and users downloading shady executables online. Unsecured/trusted local networks just makes it easier for an attacker to compromise your other assets and services. Cloud apps might actually be an advantage here since you can benefit from plug and play CASB and EDR solutions by Microsoft. If you're concerned about data security over the network you can always have your users use VPNs, but with HTTPS I don't know how much value that will be for you right now.  And of course enforce MFA like others said. It can be trivial for attackers to spray account credentials they bought on the dark web and steal data immediately if your CAPs are not well set up."
cybersecurity,1mp2y6l,DLP Investigations,bitslammer,"What I've seen in the orgs I've been in were different playbooks depending on the nature of the alerts. The SOC would handle the initial triage but then may hand it off to other teams such as the data privacy team who would handle it from there. In my orgs case the data privacy team includes resources from legal as well as compliance.   Some of the ways alerts get handled are:  * Accidental/unintentional activity - data privacy team to handle with possible user training/education. If a user has frequent alerts due to carelessness may go to HR * Potential Malware/threat actor - handled as incident by SOC * Potential intentional insider threat - handled by SOC, data privacy team and HR."
cybersecurity,1mp2y6l,DLP Investigations,Sittadel,"Sort of depends where you are on the DLP maturity model.  Best case scenario:   The organization has completed a data classification, data labeling, and/or data flow mapping projects. The life of the analyst will be pretty cut and dry, reviewing alerts that show when data went outside the rules: *This Sensitive file went to an unmanaged Google Drive. Review the file from the DLP tool and escalate to some privacy officer/insider risk if this goes against company policy. Track how many of these alerts come in and recommend blocking personal storage, etc.*  Most likely scenario:   The organization has never thought about data until they had some sort of regulatory requirement that depends DLP - so they just jumped straight into DLP without the underlying framework. In that case, your DLP analysts will be needle-and-a-haystacking their way through an incredible amount of noise, because you won't have defined data flows to use to write detections. They'll mostly be responsible for determining when something is actually risky, and if there isn't a policy that sets guidelines for what kind of behavior is approved, it just comes down to intuition. It's hard to come up with a valuable example here, because the whole operation is anchored on compliance.  Regardless of where you are in maturity, the big difference is that DLP is usually less about IOCs and more about context.   I strongly recommend someone on your team draft a standard that documents what kind of criteria you look for in an incident and what steps you take from there. That way, analysts have a decision-making framework that keeps service consistent regardless of who processes the alert, and the rules of engagement will help them feel comfortable with the work that follows. *When I see X, I check Y, and I notify Z person. If a manager gets upset about that work, they can review our Standard and recommend changes that would make them feel better - but I won't change my work until the Standard changes.*"

Eg., browser history could indicate the employee is looking for another job.  Don't police behavior. Employees looking for another job doesn't represent a risk to your data\*  \*Unless you have a documented Standard that considers employee turnover as a risk factor for data loss. There's more than one opinion here, but mine is that DLP analysts restrict their attention to policy and standard enforcement. Otherwise, there's no boundaries for their work. There's the obvious negatives to employee privacy *(Well... I did some OSINT to see if they had recently connected to any recruiters on LinkedIn, and two weeks ago they shared an instagram post that included people from this other company, and that led me to their instagram...),* but your thorough overachieving analysts won't know when to conclude their investigation. The boundaries make a DLP analyst feel safe, because they don't have to feel like an unturned stone could translate to business risk.  >wondering if there's any other experiences folks might share with respect to regulation?  Have a documented Standard that explains the elements of the DLP program. Make sure this stays updated as the program matures. Make sure SLAs vary depending on regulatory relevance, and make sure the team understands the stuff that's relevant to your regulators is mission critical - every regulatory-relevant alert gets handled: *We'll review every Critical NPPI alert within 48 hours. We'll get around to the other stuff eventually.*   >Factors that might help you decide whether you can approach the employee for clarification (i.e., you don't suspect a malicious / intentional Insider Risk situation)?  I don't think employees should be approached by DLP analysts. If anything, the DLP analysts' manager should meet with a department head. This could be ad-hoc, but I would expect a short standing meeting where they review reports to be more effective.   >Are there resources / training that tackle these sorts of investigation related questions?  The thing about DLP is that it's as much of a culture issue as it is a security issue. DLP ops look so different one company to the next, so I would look to the vendor you're using for DLP for training on how to use their platform."

cybersecurity,1mohssf,When should you look at switching companies?,Kryyses,"> Would interviewing at another company in hopes to get an offer I can leverage be a bad idea?  Don't use a new job as leverage unless you're willing to leave your current job. Doing it as leverage alone is silly. If the current company you're at calls your bluff and you don't just accept the new job, you'll lose a lot of power from that point forward. I know this from being silly enough to do it myself.  Also, I'll say it's kind of wasting the new job and the other candidates' time if you're just interviewing as leverage with no intention of actually taking the job.  > Should I just leave the company altogether?  That's up to you. No one else can answer if more money trumps working somewhere you like working. I personally prize work/life balance over more money and have accepted less for jobs with more flexible hours and location. I have friends who think I'm dumb for doing that and always accept more money. Only you can answer if you should leave for more money.  > Am I wrong for wanting a higher salary?  You're never wrong for wanting what your work is worth. If your want for a salary increase is outlandish compared to the market standard, then you should get that in line a bit better, but, based on your anecdote here, you deserve more and should not feel bad for wanting it."

Large companies have processes, procedures, and strict budget/expense control. Changes don’t come quick. Trust me, they too worry about losing talent because of pay, benefits, things like that.

That should make you eligible for at least a merit increase if not a promotion.       But, if you like the job and are fine with everything else, I'd stay for at least another 1.5-2.5 years. Five years is a good number of years of experience, and by then, your current company would have promoted you, or you'll likely be able to land a better job.    On a side note, how do you know HR and finance are incredibly strict about promotions or raises? Is that something they have stated to you or said to the organization publicly? Or is that just something your boss said or watercooler talk you've picked up on?   The reason I ask is that I was in a similar position early in my career. My boss told me that he supported me getting a promotion, but HR was strict because of the budget and blah blah. Fast forward a year, and my boss leaves for a new job. After he leaves, I find out he never once brought up my promotion to his boss or HR. He was just lying to keep me in my role because he really liked taking credit for my work."

You should *always* be applying and interviewing with other companies, because internal promotions seldom provide as big of income increases as when changing employers.  Job security is good, but it's also not a reality.

""The phishing attacks typically begin with SMS, iMessage, or RCS messages using everyday scenarios, such as toll payment alerts or package delivery updates, to drive victims toward fake verification pages.  There, users are prompted to enter sensitive personal information, followed by payment card data.  The sites are often mobile-optimized to align with the devices that will receive one-time password (OTP) codes, allowing for immediate multi-factor authentication bypass.

This class says no prerequisite required but I cant help but feel there should be a class before this.  This gives me pause as it sounds like you haven't done much at all to interact with this field. Why do you think you're interested in this field if you think a fundamentals course may be too advanced for you?  I don't want to scare you off or talk you out of it, but this job is often very different from the very glamorized version of it you can get through podcasts and TV shows. I've done a little of everything over the years, and this job, while rewarding and challenging, can often be very boring, monotonous, and repetitive especially at the entry level. I've seen many aspiring analysts and engineers fall out during entry level jobs because it's so different than what they expected it to be.  On whether the fundamentals is too soon, if you're worried, you can go back to your advisor, and most colleges I've seen will have a description or breakdown of the curriculum to give you a better idea of what you'll be learning. She should have access to that.  Echoing the others though, Cybersecurity can be a difficult field to get a first job in. We are oversaturated for entry level workers. You often need something that sets you apart like prior impressive IT experience, a crazy portfolio of homelab projects, or a really good network of people willing to help you get hired.

Intro to crypto, symmetric vs assymetric encryption, CIA triad, terms definition and concept introduction like principle of least privilege, what is a ""hash"", how is it calculated, difference between hashing vs encryption, general info on certificates and signatures etc. You learn all these basics as general concepts first.  You will eventually have your first IT courses, where you set up a DC, get the AD forest up, configure users, desktops, the hypervisor environment so everything is on the same virtual switch/network etc. Thats where you learn the IT basics, and after that you start applying the security knowledge: harden the OS, implement password policies and GPO's, setup the firewall with appropriate block rules etc.\  I do agree though, that with 0 practical IT experience, getting your first security job out of college will be difficult.

I think there's a bit more nuance to what you're saying.  > A CS degree or even general IT degree is of much better value than a cyber degree.  I'm a firm believer in just getting a degree you'll actually finish. CS for instance can be a lot of math, and people might not finish it because of that. It's more important to just have the degree a lot of the time than exactly what it's in.  As someone who has done hiring recently, I typically don't care what your degree is in unless you have zero experience as you edited in. Even if you have a degree in something relevant, I'm probably still going to choose the person with any amount of true work experience in IT or InfoSec first regardless of if their degree is in something not relevant to Cybersec. Some of the best analysts, engineers, and architects I've ever worked with have had degrees in things like Linguistics, Physics, and Art History.  > Certs don’t get you into this field anymore.  Certs don't get you into this field alone anymore, but they certainly help a lot.

The other also has 2 years of Service Desk experience, an English degree, and a Sec+ and Net+. Assuming everything else is equal, I will probably consider the second candidate more seriously because they've got certs that show they have knowledge of practical Cybersecurity and Networking concepts. Also, the English degree could mean that they will have good soft skills when dealing with other departments or users.

If you have experience then sure.  But they are both far better choices for someone who has no experience in IT at all.  Certs don’t get you into this field anymore. It’s super saturated at the moment for entry level candidates.

That’s just an example though as you said.  We can observe soft skills during an interview and probationary period.
cybersecurity,1mod70i,Going back to college for Cyber Security. First semester includes Cyber Security fundamentals.,Kryyses,"Yeah, it was an extreme example which I acknowledged. Also, yeah, both candidates would make it to interviews. I'm not eliminating candidate 1 just because they have no certs. It would still be down to who interviewed better. However, the guy with more recent demonstration of Network and Security knowledge through certs is going to give me better vibes prior to the interview.  Also, most companies in private sector I've worked at don't have a true probationary period. Public sector would often have probationary periods of a month to 90 days, but it was still pretty difficult to get rid of people without a really good reason even at those jobs. If you're hired, it's a bit late to be trying to guess if your soft skills are good enough. I'm going to have a hell of a time trying to get rid of you if you only turned on your social skills long enough to get through the interview which is something I've definitely dealt with."

It'll write text that'll look right to someone with some knowledge in the subject. It takes an experienced practitioner to see where it got it wrong.       In this use case, it'd be useful to fill out the threat model, but expect a senior person to review it closely. It'll save some time, but it'd be dangerous to hand to the end user raw."

cybersecurity,1mocyvd,ELK Siem,InvalidSoup97,"For lab use? By all means use the free version. For a production environment? Please please please just pay for the licensing.   The Elastic stack rocks; I love it, it works well, the community is large and (for the most part) helpful. However, I've used several SIEMs in very large production environments and have never gone more than 6 months or so without having to ring up support. Whether it's onboarding weird, legacy log sources, an update breaking your whole deployment, or an index just causing constant problems, you're very likely going to want more specialized, on-demand, support than the open source community can provide.   In my opinion, if you're talking about mission critical tools like a SIEM or EDR and you don't have the people who built it on staff, you'll save a lot of future headaches by just forking out for the licensing/support contract."
cybersecurity,1mocyvd,ELK Siem,Fragrant_Bake4403,why not Wazuh?  we had to fond an open source solution at my last job.   We sandboxed a few options and landed on Wazuh.  (then used prometheus w Grafana for NOC and resource monitoring)
cybersecurity,1mocyvd,ELK Siem,Sittadel,"I'm seeing some answers without understanding the context.   The university needs to be clear on the goals of the SIEM.  Some teams use them for compliance only - FOSS SIEMs are great here.  Some teams use them for scoping incidents - FOSS SIEMs are pretty good at this, too.    If you want to use the SIEM for incident management or threat hunting, it gets time intensive.  Security orchestration is often built in house, so it's as effective as the talent of the team who writes scripts.  Anything you can do in a quadrant-leading SIEM can be done in FOSS (with enough time, labor, and middleware)."

cybersecurity,1mogjoc,SBOMs are incomplete.,halting_problems,"I don’t think SBOMs are intended to provide anything but insight into what’s in an application.  What actually happened is that they created a standardized way to describe dependency trees and other items in a project a project.  Instead of relying on separate reports for vendors and other tools like package managers. All of which were very different formats and had different information.  Because we standardized  the way we describe what’s in software, tooling started to be built that filled the role of SCA vendors (where most people get their insight into packages)  OWASP Dependency Track is a great example projects, and Depscan. Both are based around ingesting and producing sboms.  Your are right, a SBOM is literally just a bill of materials. No one should think of them as anything but that. We just did a good job of making standard formats for the SBOM to build useful tooling around it to gain the insights people tend to go on about.   This is why you hear “you need to do something with your SBOM, don’t just file it away”  All of this along with SLSA and CN Supply Chain best practices are doing a great job in strengthens the software supply chain and improving the agility in the way we determine if packages exist in our specific ecosystems"

cybersecurity,1mon6tb,Anyone going to Grrcon?,whitedragon551,"I live in the area. Its a good conference. Tons of sessions, tons of vendors. Get there early if you go. There's a parking ramp across the street. Parking i think is $40/day. Lots of booths and swag.   I think they do 3 specific session tracks depending on interest, but you can obviously mix and match. The tracks are really just grouped by location in the venue.   Checkin is pretty quick. Make sure you get one of the event guides. It has the location of halls, schedule for speeches and vendor layout in it so you can draw on it and circle the events you want to go to.  They have food vouchers in the swag bag they give you for lunch. Its usually pretty basic like ball park hotdogs, some shifty burgers or cold sandwiches.

cybersecurity,1mog31j,Black Cyber Insurance Conference,clayjk,"So was the message if your carrier knows you are running an ASA you automatically pay more regardless of it you can support its secured (hardened, patched, etc?) or was this just more statistical what the insurance companies were seeing play out?"
cybersecurity,1mog31j,Black Cyber Insurance Conference,balgan,"Hey! I'm the person that presented, happy to answer any questions  I've made my slides available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/balgan_tiago-ciso-summit-activity-7360798003718254593-XDpM?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAANIUZMBidJpl3s95MmT__0c2Afo_uJISq8) \- lmk if you have issues with linkedin I'll share them elsewhere   A couple of notes   1 - We work in insurance, so in general we will look at tech,scans,credential leaks, etc... (cybersecurity data) we cross it with claims data, and patterns start to emerge about what factors are more risky or not. These will lead to prince increases in premium. These are some examples of those cases   2 - Patching, or hardening of these technologies are not taken into account when doing this why?    Because       1 - Patches sometimes aren't available when a vulnerability is found and we have to price for the risk that technology represents to our overall portfolio and       2 - in general while some of ya'lls companies might care more about security and bother securing devices, the rest of the population run these largely misconfigured, or with poor patching, and we price for the portfolio with benefits being given to people that proactively show us that they care about security. (so you can think of it as sonicwall would bring your price up, but then you tell us you have good patching process and we're gonna give some credit that counters the increase from sonicwall) so in the end it all comes out to a balance, where companies that use risky tech but dont care about security get hit, but those that use risky tech but care about security come closer to neutral."
cybersecurity,1mog31j,Black Cyber Insurance Conference,dimx_00,Could this just indicate that threat actors are targeting these appliances more often because of how many are currently in use? There is no point in trying to find exploits for Windows phones when there are only a few of them still in use vs focusing on Android phones because that gives you a bigger attack surface.  I am sure they are using scales and weights to offset the numbers but even those results could be screwed because of the large ratio between the number of users for each of these appliances.   I find it hard to believe that exposed RDP is only 1.7x. To me that would probably indicate a bunch of other bad practices with the environment setup in general.
cybersecurity,1mog31j,Black Cyber Insurance Conference,Kesshh,"Makes sense. Cyber insurance is still new enough that they can only incorporate correlations in the actuarial tables. Sooner or later, they’ll have enough data to inform the model what tools, practices actually correlate to risk reduction.

cybersecurity,1mog31j,Black Cyber Insurance Conference,Dizzy_Bridge_794,No that’s wasn’t the message.   It’s that nothing stays the same.   A questionnaire is static.   The insurers are going towards live scanning.   Patching windows are critical.   A companies ability to resolve discovered vulnerabilities within 30 days or less impacts insurability.   The insurers are going to want to scan your networks more and more.  Dynamic pricing becomes a possibility.  Fortinet was on top of this list last year.

You’re trying to sell to people that deal with phishing emails and scams on a daily basis, everything their conditioned to is subconsciously saying that’s there’s no trust, so therefore don’t reply. Would COULD happen is they receive an email from x company, then if they’re interested may search for your website etc rather than a direct reply.
